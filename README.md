# Intrinsify
Intrinsify is a Python module that grabs financial data from iexfinance, calculates a rough intrinsic value using the Ben Graham formula, and displays whether or not a stock is worth buying based on the result.

The input is gathered by giving intrinsify a file path to a text file where the stock tickers are listed out, separated by commas.
